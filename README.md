## Movie-Recommender-System

Recommendation Technique is becoming very popular day by day. Some company for example, Netflix the use recommendation technique. Recommendation technique is 
very useful for user because when a viewer click a movie/drama or any other series, nerest series for next episode will appear in front of the window.

    i) Recommender based on movie description.
          In movie description I used tagline and overview columns.

          In metadata I used cast, crew, keywords and genres columns
    
3. in Hybrid Recommendation I used both Colaborative and Content Based Recommendation.
